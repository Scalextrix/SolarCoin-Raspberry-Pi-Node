Once you have your SolarCoin daemon running on an IoT device like a Raspberry Pi, you might 
need a little help understanding how to use it.

*General Monitoring
There are some useful commands to monitor your wallet:
> ~ $ solarcoind getinfo
This is a great general purpose query, it tells you most things like the software version, how 
many coins you have spendable and how many are staking, how many blocks your node is sync'd to
and how many peers you are connected to, what your IP address is and whether your wallet is 
unlocked.

However its quite hard to read when you are new, so some more targeted queries may be useful:
> ~ $ solarcoind getblockcount
Unsurprisingly tells you how many blocks your node is synchronized with.  You need to be sync'd 
with the blockchain before spending coins or staking coins (receiving coins is unaffected).

> ~ $ solarcoind getpeerinfo
Tells you more about the connections you have to peers on the network, if they are incoming or 
outgoing.

> ~ $ solarcoind getstakinginfo
Tells you if your wallet is unlocked for staking (see below) and if it is actually staking 
(both entries should be True), a reason you may be unlocked for staking but not actually staking 
is if you are not sync'd to the blockchain.

> ~ $ solarcoind getbalance
Shows you your AVAILABLE (Spendable) balance, if the amount seems too low note that any amounts 
that are locked due to them staking are not shown. 
If you arent sure use 'solarcoind getstakinginfo' to see if there is an amount of coins in the stake 
amount.  In the Receiving SolarCoin section below there is more info on checking/repairing the wallet.

*Wallet; Locked, Staking, Unlocked
In the tutorial we used 'solarcoind encryptwallet your_passphrase_here' to secure the wallet with 
a passphrase, this is to protect anyone except for you from controlling your wallet.
When you start solarcoind, your wallet is always locked, this means you cant send coins anywhere, 
nor can you earn additional rewards by staking your coins.  If you wanted to send me 1 SolarCoin 
(please dont feel obliged, its just an example!) you could do:

> ~ $ solarcoind walletpassphrase your_passphrase_here 300
Lets disect that for a moment; 'solarcoind' is the way to issue any command to SolarCoin, 
'walletpassphrase' tells the wallet you want to unlock the wallet 'your_passphrase_here' is 
whatever you chose as your passphrase '300' is the number of seconds to unlock the wallet for,
after which it will become locked again.  So now you have 5 minutes to send the coins to me.

To send the coins:
> ~ $ solarcoind sendtoaddress 8cESoZyjFvx2Deq6VjQLqPfAwu8UXjcBkK 1
Lets disect that for a moment; 'solarcoind' to send the instruction, 'sendtoaddress' to tell the 
wallet you want to send coins, '8cESoZyjFvx2Deq6VjQLqPfAwu8UXjcBkK' is my wallet address, '1' is the
amount of SLR to send.  When you hit return you will get a long string of numbers and letters, this
is the transaction hash and lets you know it worked.  Also you could message me with this and I
could see that you had sent the coins, useful as a proof of payment for example.

To lock a wallet:
Lets say you accidentally did:
> ~ $ solarcoind walletpassphrase your_passphrase_here 30000
Now your wallet is open for a long time (30000 seconds), and for security you want to lock it again
before the time expires, just do:
> ~ $ solarcoind walletlock
Thats it, 'walletlock' locks the wallet, easy.

Now there is an intermediate state of the wallet, that is used for staking your coins (earning 
interest on them), the wallet is unlocked, but ONLY for staking, no other transactions are allowed.
You will probably want to leave your wallet in this state most of the time to earn interest.
The command is:
> ~ $ solarcoind walletpassphrase your_passphrase_here 9999999 true
Lets disect that: 'solarcoind walletpassphrase your_passphrase_here' is exacly the same as fully unlocking
your wallet to send an amount, but we have '9999999' for the seconds and 'true' at the end.  
9999999 seconds effectively means forever, and the 'true' means unlock the wallet, but for staking only.

So lets take the scenario where your wallet is unlocked for staking, and you want to transfer me that 1 SLR,
you need to do:
> ~ $ solarcoind walletlock                                          (your wallet is UNLOCKED for staking, so first you must lock it)
> ~ $ solarcoind walletpassphrase your_passphrase_here 300           (fully unlock for 5 minutes, to allow the transaction)
> ~ $ solarcoind sendtoaddress 8cESoZyjFvx2Deq6VjQLqPfAwu8UXjcBkK 1  (send me 1 SLR)
> ~ $ solarcoind walletlock                                          (lock the wallet again, or you could just wait 5 minutes)
> ~ $ solarcoind walletpassphrase your_passphrase_here 9999999 true  (unlock the wallet for staking again)

*Receiving SolarCoin
Its often advisable to generate a new wallet address each time you do a transaction to help hide your 
identity, if you ever want a new wallet address, simply:
> ~ $ solarcoind getnewaddress

If you want to see a list of existing addresses, its a bit more complicated and is really much easier in a 
Qt wallet, but you can issue command:
> ~ $ solarcoind listunspent
it will show you batches of coins, numbers of confirmations and the addresses which they are associated to, 
its not easy to read though.

Sometimes you might need to repair the wallet, the reasons for this are complex, but if you suddenly notice
your balances seem wrong you can try
> ~ $ solarcoind checkwallet
or
> ~ $ solarcoind repairwallet

*Backup your wallet regularly, no really, BACKUP YOUR WALLET REGULARLY!!
Finally, remember to keep regular backups of your wallet, if the SD card on your Pi fails, or if there is 
some other failure ALL YOUR SOLARCOINS COULD BE LOST FOREVER, unless you have a recent backup, so ideally 
keep one on at least one other offline device:
> ~ $ solarcoind backupwallet /destination/directory/of/your/choice
